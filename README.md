I love to share things without to much protocol. I know it is important for formal settings, fortunately this Github README is not. So I can say things without to much structure, yeah!

Like _to code_,  
and _love Vim_,  
like to give projects,  
avery good dosis of documentation.  
Really, and it isn't masochism.  
It is that I also like to write; a lot.  

Possibly I will be updating my [page](https://u-m-i.github.io) soon with more of my poems and writings, in the mean time:
