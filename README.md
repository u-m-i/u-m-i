# 'bout me

More than I like _to code_ and I _love Vim_, I also like to give projects a very good dosis of documentation. Really, and it isn't masochism. It is that I also like to write; a lot.
So possibly I will be updading my [page] soon with more of my poems and writings, in the mean time:

## Working on ⚒️

* Bga Buses - Want to see updates? [Follow my post on DEV.to](https://dev.to/umi_84/bga-buses-mux-challenge-53c4)
* [Umman](https://www.umman.es)
* [Humedal Abreo Mal Paso](https://humedalabreomalpaso.github.io/) - Protect the wetland!
* Web Terminal - This is keep secret 🥸
* [Dangerous](https://github.com/u-m-i/dangerous) - My fork of [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) that implements all HTTP verbs.

## Reading

* "Crimen y Castigo" - Fyodor Dostoiesvky
* About the LPM (Longest Prefix Match)
* "Guerras y Capital" - Maurizio Lazzarato & Érik Alliez

## Favorities things 😁

* The simplicity of the `.md` format
* Macchiato and V60 with metallic and paper filter
* Cloudy days

## Trying to learn 

* More German!

## I don't like (I hate those)

_Mosquitos._
